      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh hey, look at that! It&amp;rsquo;s February already, time to properly announce my second #1GAM creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, this one was conceived as a mash-up of Spy Hunter and Juno First. Currently there&amp;rsquo;s more Spy Hunter in there than anything, with just a hint of 3D projection taken from Juno First - I might come back to that later this year and do it properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month will be one of the harder challenges since we&amp;rsquo;re visiting Mrs. Beerman&amp;rsquo;s family in Texas for a week, which cuts a chunk out of my dev time. Because I&amp;rsquo;m a smart chap I planned ahead for this by making sure my January game was simple enough to finish early, giving me an extra week to work on the next one. Because I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; a smart chap, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give my productivity and focus a &lt;i&gt;spectacular&lt;/i&gt; boost by buying Skyrim&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
