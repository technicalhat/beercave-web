      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time again, where I take a look back at the events of the last year and ask the question : what the hell was all that about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous installments : &lt;a href=&#34;https://technicalhat.github.io/beercave-web/2012/01/01/post-mortem-2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://technicalhat.github.io/beercave-web/2010/12/31/2010-and-all&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my plans for the year ganged pretty damn agly but everything pretty much worked itself out in the end. Seems I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the required hustle for contracting - after 6 months on the bench my cash reserves were pretty much all gone, Mrs Beerman was beginning to get a little impatient with bankrolling me, and our conveniently-timed rent-free house/cat sitting deal was fixing to expire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the game development front, Playing Gods was sadly cancelled and Droidy Shooty Thing was an engine looking for a game. The outlook was bleak for our Hero.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
