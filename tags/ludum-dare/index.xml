      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, weren&amp;rsquo;t you making some kind of OutRun-inspired racing game?&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;re no doubt wondering. Well yes, that was indeed the plan - but as (according to the internets) every famous military leader in history&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote1&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; said, &amp;ldquo;No battle plan ever survived contact with the enemy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that game&amp;rsquo;s not by any means dead yet, but with the end of the month approaching far too quickly it was becoming apparent that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to get it anywhere near done in time., Too much time spent twatting around trying to get the rendering perfectm not enough spent making it actually playable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, last weekend was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo&#34;&gt;Ludum Dare 26&lt;/a&gt;, which gave me an excuse to temporarily shelve the racer and get down to some Jammin&amp;rsquo;. The theme this time around was &amp;ldquo;minimalism&amp;rdquo;, and I conveniently had an idea lying around that I reckoned would more or less fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://technicalhat.github.io/beercave-web/games/gunboat&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enough already - show me the damn game!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What&#39;s next?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So Lagertron is pretty much complete as a game now. Few minor fixes and a little bit of polish and I should have something fit for release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as luck would have it, it&amp;rsquo;s once again time for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/09/27/announcing-october-challenge-2012/&#34;&gt;Ludum Dare October Challenge.&lt;/a&gt; You &lt;a href=&#34;https://technicalhat.github.io/beercave-web/category/tags/october-challenge&#34;&gt;may remember&lt;/a&gt; I made an attempt at it a couple of years ago, only to be brought down by an overly-ambitious game attempt that never got finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around though, I&amp;rsquo;ve already got most of a working game ready to go, and based on the reactions I got demoing it at Retrovision this past weekend I should have at least a few sales in the bag too :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the tentative plan is to focus on the mobile version for now, maybe add some online high scores and some kind of tutorial/practice mode (one thing I did notice is that the controls were confusing the hell out of a lot of people) and bung it up on the Play store. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking one paid version and one ad-supported would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s time, I&amp;rsquo;d also like to finish up the desktop version and release that somewhere too. Will need some serious testing on machines that aren&amp;rsquo;t mine before release though, for all the crying I hear about Android &amp;ldquo;fragmentation&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s got nothing on the state of the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
