      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was when I careered into the pub car park in a vehicle with no brakes for the second time in one day that I knew it was going to be a good weekend. The Beermobile had thoughtfully held it together for the preceding 200 miles or so before finally deciding to dump hydraulic fluid all over the road about half a mile from my final destination. Not the most auspicious of starts to the ROM retro gaming festival, but it could only get better from there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
