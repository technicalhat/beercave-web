      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, weren&amp;rsquo;t you making some kind of OutRun-inspired racing game?&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;re no doubt wondering. Well yes, that was indeed the plan - but as (according to the internets) every famous military leader in history&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote1&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; said, &amp;ldquo;No battle plan ever survived contact with the enemy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that game&amp;rsquo;s not by any means dead yet, but with the end of the month approaching far too quickly it was becoming apparent that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to get it anywhere near done in time., Too much time spent twatting around trying to get the rendering perfectm not enough spent making it actually playable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, last weekend was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo&#34;&gt;Ludum Dare 26&lt;/a&gt;, which gave me an excuse to temporarily shelve the racer and get down to some Jammin&amp;rsquo;. The theme this time around was &amp;ldquo;minimalism&amp;rdquo;, and I conveniently had an idea lying around that I reckoned would more or less fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://technicalhat.github.io/beercave-web/games/gunboat&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enough already - show me the damn game!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
