                    <p>Well, that about wraps it up for 2013. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a busy one, so this might take a while&hellip;</p>

<p>_Previously on &ldquo;what&rsquo;s Beerman been up to this year&rdquo; : _</p>

<p><a href="/2013/01/07/2012-was-fun">2012</a>

<a href="/2010/12/31/2010-and-all">2010</a></p>

<p>Work-wise, things have been a tad more stable. I&rsquo;m considerably happier with the less corporate-bullshitty/cult-of-personality environment of the new gig, despite occasional forays into the Hell that is Sharepoint. My God, someone needs hurting for that thing&hellip;</p>

<p>Not that you guys care - if anyone&rsquo;s genuinely coming here to read about the ins and outs of my day job I&rsquo;m frankly a bit worried about them. So, on to the games!</p>

<p>So, as you may have noticed (I mentioned it once or twice, I&rsquo;m sure), back at the end of 2012 I managed to talk myself into signing up for <a href="https://twitter.com/mcfunkypants">@McFunkyPants</a>&rsquo; <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">One Game a Month</a> initiative. And damn, it&rsquo;s been quite a ride.</p>

<h3 id="january-chaosball-games-1gam-2013-chaosball"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/chaosball">January : ChaosBall</a></h3>

<div>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Kicking off the year in style, ChaosBall was an exercise in taking entirely simple game design in the form of a Breakout clone, and then spending most of the time budget on polish and making things pretty. While I didn&rsquo;t quite go full <a href="http://bagfullofwrong.co.uk/bagfullofwords/">Fearon</a> with the visuals, it still looks pretty damn good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m particularly pleased with the sound - the overdriven 909 kick drum I used for the bounces gives it a really nice &ldquo;frenzied gabber choonz&rdquo; vibe when things get moving.</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/juno-hunter">February : Juno Hunter</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/2+-+junohunter.png"/></p>

<p>This one&rsquo;s still one of my favourites. Initially planned as a sort of hybrid of Juno First* and Spy Hunter, between a week in Texas visiting Mrs. Beerman&rsquo;s family, a second week recovering from the coma induced by a week of Texan cuisine, and my brilliantly timed purchase of Skyrim, there was a certain amount of scope-trimming involved.</p>

<p>In the end though, thanks to a sudden burst of inspiration at the last minute it turned into a fun a challenging little game that&rsquo;s just ripe for a revisit in 2014.</p>

<p><i>*Which I really do need to get around to remaking properly one of these days&hellip;</i></p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/rogueotron">March : Rogueotron</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/3+-+rogueotron.png"/></p>

<p>This one kind of came out of nowhere. I&rsquo;d been planing on a F2P remix of Lagertron as an excuse to have a play with the Android IAP stuff when the March theme of &ldquo;Rogue&rdquo; was announced. I&rsquo;m not big on roguelikes as a rule - there&rsquo;s a bit of a wilfully obscurist vibe to the genre that tends to put me off - but if there&rsquo;s three things I do like it&rsquo;s procedural generation, Robotron*, and terrible puns.</p>

<p>So after a quick google to check that nobody had beaten me to it, Rogueotron was born. And it was good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not 100% sold on the touchscreen controls, but other than that it seems like there&rsquo;s so much more I could do with the basic concept. Definitely one to revisit in 2014.</p>

<p><i>*Someone once described the history of Philosophy as &ldquo;<a href="http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/philosophy/footnotes_plato.html">footnotes to Plato</a>&rdquo;. I tend to think similarly of videogames as &ldquo;footnotes to Robotron.&rdquo; If there&rsquo;s been a more pseudish statement made on gaming, I&rsquo;d love to hear it ;)</i></p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/gunboat">April: GunBoat</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/4+-+gunboat.png"/></p>

<p>This was the first of my &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> saves the day&rdquo; games. I&rsquo;d been working on an Outrun style psuedo 3d racing game but with the month running out all I had was a bug-ridden mess. So LD26&rsquo;s theme of &ldquo;minimalism&rdquo; was an absolute gift.</p>

<p>I had an idea already floating around (in an &ldquo;I need to make this thing to get it out of my head&rdquo; kind of way) that fit the theme perfectly, and after a couple of days of frenzied hacking I had a game for the month.</p>

<p>Dunno if there&rsquo;s anything in there that warrants an extension at some point, but I did end up building a GUI system that got pretty heavy reuse the rest of the year, and I really like how the general aesthetic of this one came together.</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/beercave-racer">May : Beercave Racer</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/5+-+racer.png"/></p>

<p>Oh dear. If there&rsquo;s one game this year I&rsquo;d consider a failure, it&rsquo;s this one. Which could be considered odd, given that it&rsquo;s had 10 times more many downloads on the Play store than any of my other games. To be fair, the entire reason I decided to make this one was as a coding exercise to see if I could get the renderer to work, which I did a fairly decent job at.</p>

<p>The actual game I built on top of it though wasn&rsquo;t so great. Terrible controls, a poorly tuned road generator, and not nearly enough visual assets leave this one as somewhat of a failed experiment. Not sure racing games are really my medium&hellip;</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/lawbringer">June : LawBringer</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/6+-+lawbringer.png"/></p>

<p>I had a plan for June&rsquo;s game. It was simple, easy to implement, and I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to care about it for any length of time. Fortunately, after sitting down and forcing myself to code the basics, it occurred to me that I could &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; as the cool kids on HackerNews call it, add a bunch of lasers and explosions, and make something I actually liked.</p>

<p>I only had a week left to actually build the damn thing so it&rsquo;s not exactly epic in scope but there&rsquo;s something there that&rsquo;s just crying out for further development. It&rsquo;s a better shooter than Droidy Shooty Thing ever managed to be and I burned most of a year on that thing&hellip;</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/headbanger">July : Head Banger</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/7+-+headbanger.png"/></p>

<p>Probably not the best game I made this year, but it might be the one I had the most fun with. As a raging headbanger, I couldn&rsquo;t let the theme of Metal go by without taking a pop at it, and the early Llamasoft game &ldquo;Headbangers Heaven&rdquo; seemed like prime remake material.</p>

<p>The end result might not have been brilliant gameplay wise, but I was pretty happy with both the stark graphics I came up with (a real step up from my usual drawing attempts) and the four cheesy music tracks I made (fun fact - the &ldquo;Death Metal&rdquo; track is basically the Tetris theme played at ludicrous speed).</p>

<p>The best thing about it though, was easily the random band name generator that came out with gems like &ldquo;Bob and the Wankers&rdquo;, &ldquo;SteelFuck&rdquo; and &ldquo;Witch at the Fight&rdquo;. I could have happily sat and just hit refresh on that thing for hours if I didn&rsquo;t have a game to finish.</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/open-box">August : Open The Box</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/8+-+openbox.png"/></p>

<p>Ludum Dare rescue number 2! Flush with a feeling of success for hitting the July Theme with Headbanger, August&rsquo;s theme of &ldquo;Philosophy&rdquo; sparked an excellent, if massively overscoped idea in the form of an epic historical quest of intellectual content and gratuitous violence.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, everything I know about philosophy I learned from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_WRFJwGsbY">Monty Python</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Anniversary/dp/0099322617/ref=la_B000AP5XN4_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1388444874&sr=1-1">Robert Pirsig</a> - as the month started to draw to an end I was planning to cut the scope massively but LD27&rsquo;s theme of &ldquo;10 seconds&rdquo; again sparked an idea that I couldn&rsquo;t let go of.</p>

<p>The Saturday was entirely sacrificed to beer and BBQ* but after rolling out of bed around lunchtime on Sunday I still had enough time to hack together &ldquo;Open the Box&rdquo;, which for 12 hours of coding wasn&rsquo;t half bad.</p>

<p><i>*For the Brits in the audience, BBQ doesn&rsquo;t mean just grilling a couple of Tesco Value burgers and sausages. I married a Texan. I mean slow-smoked pork ribs, or as my good mate and musical collaborator <a href="https://soundcloud.com/governmentyard">Governmentyard</a> memorably described it &ldquo;spit roasting an elephant and listening to Ozzy all afternoon&rdquo;</i></p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/electric-sex-cannon">September : Electric Sex Cannon</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/9+-+esc.png"/></p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s been a better videogame title this year I&rsquo;ve not heard of it. Both the name and the idea of a shooty endless runner had been bouncing around the darker regions of my brainium for a while.</p>

<p>The keen-eyed might recognise the background as a desaturated clone of the sky from GunBoat, along with some slightly randomised parallax layers of futuristic buildings, and while the enemies were a bit limited in scope thanks to the deadline and my chronic laziness, it still manages to be fairly entertaining.</p>

<p>Alongside ESC&rsquo;s development I also managed to take a couple of days out to patch up a competition-friendly build of Juno Hunter to take to the inaugural <a href="http://www.retromission.co.uk/">Retromission</a> event down in Oxford, since I&rsquo;d let myself get talked into running the homebrew games highscore competition.</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/candy-castle-chaos">October : Candy Castle Chaos</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/10+-+castles.png"/></p>

<p>By this point, I was beginning to notice a common theme in what I was finding difficult ant time consuming : content. Fortunately, at the aforementioned Retromission event I&rsquo;d been exposed to the perfect all-gameplay-no-content option in the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Mayhem">2600 remake</a> of Atari&rsquo;s classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlords_(1980_video_game)">Warlords</a>. After destroying all comers in the tournament I was feeling pretty confident that I could do something with it.</p>

<p>And so CCC was born (an earlier title was Kandy Kastle Khaos, which I abandoned for obvious reasons despite K being clearly a cooler letter than C&hellip;). Another good one, which really cemented how much fun I could have with the whole retro vector aesthetic - which leads us to&hellip;</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/web-runner">November : WebRunner</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/11+-+webrunner.png"/></p>

<p>I literally do not have the words to describe just how pleased I am with this one. This wasn&rsquo;t a good #1gam game, this was just a good game. Obviously it didn&rsquo;t hurt that I was following a template laid down by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Theurer ">Theurer</a> and extended so gloriously by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Minter">Minter</a>, but goddamn this one came together nicely.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something just beautifully pure in the DNA of Tempest that it&rsquo;s hard to fuck it up - unless you&rsquo;re putting a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMb0UVyGk5c">prawn on some underpants</a> of course&hellip;</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;"><a href="/games/1gam-2013/brown-christmas">December : Brown Christmas</a></h3>
<img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/beercave.co.uk/gameamonth2013/pics/12+-+brownxmas.png"/></p>

<p>I make no apologies for this one. Way back at the start of the year when I was brainstorming ideas, one of the first I came up with was &ldquo;An evil Santa who shits in the naughty kids&rsquo; stockings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And you just can&rsquo;t put an idea like that down, or at least I can&rsquo;t. My inner twelve-year-old jumped all over that one and refused to let it go.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not by any means the best platformer ever made, but I think it does a reasonable job of capturing that mid-80s Jet Set Willy-esque blend of brutally frustrating gameplay and pure British silliness.</p>

<p><h3 style="clear:both;">So now what?</h3>
Well, first of all I&rsquo;m taking at least a copule of weeks off. I am <em>way</em> behind on my media consumption this year - got at least 6 months of 2000AD to catch up on before I even start thinking about TV and movies and games and stuff.</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;ve had a thorough mental decompress, I plan to take a look back over some of the things I made this year and see about turning a few of them into bona fide commercial productions that people might actually pay real money for.</p>
