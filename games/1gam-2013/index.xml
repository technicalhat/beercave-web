      <description>&amp;lsquo;twas the night before Christmas and Santa was mad
His fill of those naughty kids he&amp;rsquo;d just about had
This year would be different, he&amp;rsquo;d show that bad lot
He set off on his sleigh with a vengeful plot
He&amp;rsquo;d filled up on curry, and foaming dark ale
His bowels were loaded, his plan could not fail
That bright Christmas morning, they&amp;rsquo;d find in dismay
A brown stocking filler to darken their day</description>
